# Megrez
Megrez is a C++ library that provides efficient multi-dimensional array operations and related small utilities.

Currently, the operation support (＋,－,×,÷) for the Boost MultiDimensional Array Library has been implemented. It works for arries with any dimensions. For arries with different dimensions, a low-level broadcasting has been implemented such that operations can be completed if their trailing dimensions match.
